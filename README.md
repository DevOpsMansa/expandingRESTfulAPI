# Expanding a RESTful API

## Objectives
* Add additional features to an existing RESTful Express API.
* Refactor existing code for efficiency, organization, and/or performance.

## Instructions
You will begin with the example application that was explored during the lesson.
* If you have already created a working local copy of that application, wonderful! Continue with that as the starting point for this assignment.
* Otherwise, download the final example CodeSandbox using the top-left menu.
    Once downloaded, rename the directory to an appropriate project name.
    Run git init to establish a git repository within the directory.
    Run npm install to install the application dependencies.
    Test the application by running nodemon index.js and navigating to localhost:3000.# expandingRESTfulAPI
